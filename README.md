## Introduction 
Walls & Warriors is a board game with different challenges of various difficulty levels designed for improving problem solving abilities for ages from 8 to adult [1]. For our version,  there will be two gameplay modes and the game is going to be implemented as a desktop application.

There are a number of blue knights, red knights and a high tower positioned in each challenge as well as distinct wall pieces to be placed by the player.
## Rules
- Wall pieces should properly align on the grid of the board. Meaning that, walls cannot end on the bastions of another wall.
- Blue knights and the high tower should remain within the walls.
- Red knights should be kept outside of the walls.
- Walls should be enclosed by all sides.
## Gameplay
- The player chooses a challenge to solve. 
- Knights and the high tower are placed on the board.
- Walls available for the particular challenge are given to the player. 
- The player places the walls according to the rules.
## Challenges
**Standard Challenges:** In each challenge, the player is given 4 wall pieces, a high tower, and up to 3 blue and 4 red knights. The board is in a standard shape and size. 

**Wild Challenges:** The number of wall pieces and knights can be customized by the player within the limits. Likewise, the size and shape of the grid is not necessarily standard. 
## Modes
**Campaign:** The player is given standard challenges on a basis of increasing difficulties. Harder challenges are being unlocked as the player progresses on easier challenges. 

**Custom Mode:** The player can play challenges created by the game community. These challenges can be both standard and free.
