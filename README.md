## Original Game Description
The principle of this game place the four walls on the game board so that all the blue knights are inside the enclosure and all the red knights are on the outside. But instead of defending an ancient city, you now have to defend a castle. The knights are more detailed and more stable, the walls are bigger and easier to handle, and with 80 challenges instead of the former 60, there was space to add a few easier challenges that include hints. However, there is always only one correct solution, which can be found at the back of the challenge booklet. For ages 8 to adult.

## Game Requirements 
Walls & Warriors is a board game with different challenges of various difficulty levels designed for improving problem solving abilities for ages from 8 to adult [1]. For our version,  there will be two gameplay modes and the game is going to be implemented as a desktop application. To transfer the game into desktop environment, we decided to use dragging and dropping for ease of use and user-friendliness in addition to a set of pre-loaded challenges that will be offered to the user in the Campaign Mode. A "How To Play" section will be available with the same principles as the booklet in the original board game. Our version of the game also offers additional features. The player to create their own challenges and sharing them with the Walls and Warriors community, as long as the challenges are solveable. There are two types for creating challenges, standard and wild. In Wild mode, the creator is provided an unlimited number of resources and various size of grids to create his/her challenge. Additionally, there will be sounds added for object movements to increase entertainability.  

There are a number of blue knights, red knights and a high tower positioned in each challenge as well as distinct wall pieces to be placed by the player.

### Rules
- Wall pieces should properly align on the grid of the board. Meaning that, walls cannot end on the bastions of another wall.
- Blue knights and the high tower should remain within the walls.
- Red knights should be kept outside of the walls.
- Walls should be enclosed by all sides.

### Gameplay
- The player chooses a challenge to solve. 
- Knights and the high tower are placed on the board.
- Walls available for the particular challenge are given to the player. 
- The player places the walls according to the rules.

### Challenges
**Standard Challenges:** In each challenge, the player is given 4 wall pieces, a high tower, and up to 3 blue and 4 red knights. The board is in a standard shape and size. 

**Wild Challenges:** The number of wall pieces and knights can be customized by the player within the limits. Likewise, the size and shape of the grid is not necessarily standard. 

### Modes
**Campaign:** The player is given standard challenges on a basis of increasing difficulties. Harder challenges are being unlocked as the player progresses on easier challenges. 

**Custom Mode:** The player can play challenges created by the game community. These challenges can be both standard and free.
